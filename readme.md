Originally Started As Prototype for a JSF CC/tag/element that would deal with get params; 
but then morphed into other things. 


Currently, this has some sample code and patterns for: 

* Possible pattern for categorizing enum patterns
* Privilege access checking via an 'Authorizer' 
* Pattern for verifying that a controller can operate on the current state (i.e. 
check permissibility of processing submitted data)
